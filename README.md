# Rainfall-Prediction
 In this project our aim is to
 •To determine important factors affecting rainfall.
 •To find out the correlation between different factors affecting rainfall.
 •To analyze the impact of certain weather conditions on rainfall. 
 •To build a ML model to predict rainfall
 
We build three models to compare and choose the best performing model.
 
The Random forest classifier gives an accuracy of 85.33%.
The Gausian naive bayes model gives an accuracy of 80.73%.
The K Nearest neighbour model with gives an accuracy of 83.81%
